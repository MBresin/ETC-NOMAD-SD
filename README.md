# ETC-NOMAD-SD
Moving Light controls for ETC Nomad. For use with Companion and a Streamdeck +.

This Layout requires the Generic OSC Module, and for full funtionality, also needs the ETC-Eos Module.

Network config is Key to setup. I would suggest Static IP's so you dont need to configure multiple times.
